This morning we arrived at kutching, the capital of Sarawak. We had to get up at
4am so we were pretty torn out when we arrived. We fought the tireness though
and decided to get to know the city a little better with a walk. It didn't take
long before we fell in love kuching and it's beautiful Sarawak river.
